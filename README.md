Optimizing Delinquent Customer Collections with Machine Learning

The Credit Services Collections portfolio faced challenges with inefficient delinquent customer outreach, leading to wasted resources and low communication success. To address this, a machine learning model was developed to predict optimal contact strategies. This involved gathering data from disparate systems, cleaning and preprocessing it, and employing feature selection to identify key variables. After evaluating various algorithms, Random Forest was chosen and optimized through hyperparameter tuning, raising accuracy from 62% to 73%. The result was a 66% reduction in contact frequency while maintaining collections effectiveness, and an increase in customer satisfaction through personalized communication. This data-driven approach transformed the collections process, optimizing operations and enhancing customer experience.
